2, He , Helium,1868,Jules Janssen,"A French astronomer, Pierre-Jules-César Janssen, first discovered helium during the solar eclipse of 1868 in India when he detected a yellow line (587.49 nm) in the solar spectrum very close to the yellow sodium D-line. For many years helium was regarded as an element that might exist on the sun although it was unknown on the Earth."
3, Li , Lithium,1817,Johan Arfvedson,"Lithium was discovered by Johan August Arfvedson in 1817 during an analysis of petalite ore, an ore now recognised to be LiAl(Si2O5)2, taken from the Swedish island of Utö. Arfvedson subsequently discovered lithium in the minerals spodumene and lepidolite. C.G. Gmelin observed in 1818 that lithium salts colour flames bright red."
4, Be , Beryllium,1798,M.L. Vauquelin,The element was recognised by M.-L. Vauquelin in 1798 in beryl and emeralds. The metal was isolated much later on in 1828 by Friederich Wöhler (and independently by A.-A.B. Bussy) by the action of potassium on BeCl2 in a platinum crucible. Beryl were both known to early Egyptians but it was not realised until the end of the 18th century
5, B , Boron,1807,Sir Humphry Davy,"Boron was first isolated in England in 1807 by Sir Humphry Davy and then in France in 1808 by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Louis Jacques Thénard.

6, C , Carbon,Ancient,,"Carbon as charcoal, soot and coal has been used since prehistoric times. Carbon as diamond has also been known since very ancient times. The recognition that soot (amorphous carbon), graphite (another form of carbon) and diamond are all forms of carbon."
7, N , Nitrogen,1772,Daniel Rutherford,"It was known during the 18th century that air contains at least two gases, one of which is oxygen which supports combustion and life, and the other was nitrogen which does not. Nitrogen was discovered by Daniel Rutherford in 1772, who called it noxious air."
8, O , Oxygen,1774,Joseph Priestly,Leonardo da Vinci suggested that air consists of at least two different gases and of these one of the gas supported flames and life. Oxygen was prepared by several workers before 1772 but these workers did not recognize it as an element. Joseph Priestley is generally credited with its discovery (who made oxygen by heating lead or mercury oxides).
9, F , Fluorine,1670,George Gore,"In 1670 a recipe containing calcium fluoride, CaF2 was used to etch glass. It seems that George Gore made a little fluorine through an electrolytic process but his apparatus exploded when the fluorine produced reacted with hydrogen from the other electrode. The element finally was isolated in 1886 by Ferdinand Frederic Henri Moisson."
10, Ne , Neon,1898,"Sir William Ramsay, Morris Travers",Neon was discovered by Sir William Ramsay and Morris Travers in 1898 very shortly after their discovery of the element krypton. Both elements were discovered through work on liquid air.
11, Na , Sodium,1807,Sir Humphry Davy,"Until the 18th century no distinction was made between potassium and sodium.

18, Ar , Argon,1894,"Lord Rayleigh, Sir William Ramsay",Argon was first obtained by Lord Rayleigh and Sir William Ramsay in 1894. Previously Lord Rayleigh had noticed that a liter of supposedly pure nitrogen drawn from the air weighed more than a liter prepared from a nitrogen compound. This difference in weight led him to conclude that another gas was present in the supposedly pure nitrogen.
19, K , Potassium,1807,Humphry Davy,"Potassium was discovered in 1807 by Humphry Davy, who decomposed potash with an electric current. Potassium was the first metal so discovered; Davy discovered sodium a few days later by a similar experiment."
20, Ca , Calcium,Ancient,,"Compounds such as lime (CaO, calcium oxide) were prepared by the Romans in the first century under the name calx.

24, Cr , Chromium,Ancient,,"In the mid 18th century analysis of Siberian ""red lead"" (PbCrO4, crocoite) from Siberia showed that it contained quite a lot of lead, but also a further material. This was eventually identified as chromium oxide. Chromium oxide was discovered in 1797 by Louis-Nicholas Vauquelin, who prepared the metal itself in the following year."
25, Mn , Manganese,1774,Johann Gahn,"Manganese metal was isolated by Gahn in 1774. He reduced the dioxide (MnO2, as the mineral pyrolusite) with charcoal (essentially carbon) by heating and the result was a sample of the metal manganese."

No doubt they discovered its toxic properties early on.It is believed that Albertus Magnus obtained the element in 1250 A.D. who obtained it by heating soap together with orpiment (arsenic trisulphide, As2S3)."
34, Se , Selenium,1817,Jöns Jacob Berzelius ,"Selenium (Gr. Selen, moon) was discovered by Jöns Jacob Berzelius in 1817. He reported that tellurium was present in sulphuric acid from a Swedish factory, but in the following year decided that the impurity was not tellurium but another closely related element that he subsequently identified as selenium."
35, Br , Bromine,1826,Antoine Balard,"Bromine was not prepared in quantity until 1860 but compounds of bromine were of some considerable importance well before it was recognised as an element. Long ago an excretion from a particular kind of mussel was used to make a purple dye called ""Tyrian purple."" It is now known that a key compound in this process is an organobromine compund."

39, Y , Yttrium,1794,Johann Gadolin,"Yttria (yttrium oxide, Y2O3), was discovered by Johann Gadolin in 1794 in a mineral called gadolinite from Ytterby, a town in Finland. Friedrich Wohler obtained the impure element in 1828 by reduction of the anhydrous chloride (YCl3) with potassium."
40, Zr , Zirconium,1789,Martin Klaproth,"The name zircon probably originated from the arabic ""zargun,"" which describes the colour of the gemstone now known as zircon. Zirconium was discovered by Martin Heinrich Klaproth at 1789 in Berlin, Germany. The minerals jargon, hyacinth, and jacinth also contain zircon and these have been known since biblical times and are mentioned in the bible."
41, Nb , Niobium,1801,Charles Hatchett,"Niobium was discovered in 1801 by Charles Hatchett in an ore called columbite. He was not able to isolate the free element. There was then considerable confusion concerning the distinction between niobium and tantalum as they are so closely related. This confusion was resolved by Heinrich Rose, who named niobium."
42, Mo , Molybdenum,1778,Karl Scheele,"Molybdenum was recognized as a distinct element in 1778 by K. W. Scheele; its ore had earlier been confused with lead ore, hence its name.

73, Ta , Tantalum,1802,Anders Ekeberg,"Niobium was discovered in by Anders Ekeberg, but many chemists thought niobium and tantalum were the same. Some felt that perhaps tantalum was an allotrope of niobium. Later, Rose, in 1844, and Marignac, in 1866, showed that niobic and tantalic acids were two different acids.The first relatively pure tantalum was produced by von Bolton in 1907."
74, W , Tungsten,1783,"Fausto, Juan Jose de Elhuyar","Tungsten used to be known as wolfram (from wolframite, said to be named from wolf rahm or spumi lupi, because the ore interfered with the smelting of tin and was supposed to devour the tin).
